A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. The Remote - Containers extension in the [Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) extension pack allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a dev container and take advantage of VS Code's full development feature set.

This repository contains a set of **dev container definitions** to help get you up and running with a containerized environment. The definitions describe the appropriate container image, runtime arguments for starting the container, and VS Code extensions that should be installed. They can also be used as examples for adapting your own configuration to different situations.

## Using a definition

To add a dev container definition in your project, you can either:

- Add it using VS Code:
  
  1. If this is your first time creating a dev container, follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to configure your machine.
  2. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
  3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd>
  and select either the **Remote-Containers: Create Container Configuration File...** or **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** commands.
  4. Follow the directions and pick one of the existing development container definitions in this repository from the list.

- Or manually copy the contents of one of the folders in the `containers` directory into your project. You should be able to copy just the `.devcontainer` folder and ignore everything else. See the definition's `README` for details.

## Adding a definition to an existing repository

You can share a customized dev container definition for your project by adding the files under `.devcontainer` to source control. Anyone who then opens a local copy of your repo in VS Code will be prompted to reopen the folder in a container, provided they have the [Remote Development](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) extension pack installed.

Your team now has a consistent environment and tool-chain and new contributors or team members can be productive quickly. First-time contributors will require less guidance and there will be fewer issues related to environment setup.

## Testing a definition

If you want to test a definition before choosing one:

1. If this is your first time creating a dev container, follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to configure your machine.
2. Browse the contents of the  `containers` folder in this repository and pick one. Review the `README` to see if there are any manual setup steps before continuing.
3. Clone this repository locally.
4. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and run the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
5. Select the root of the definition folder from the cloned repository when prompted (**not** the `test-project` folder if present).
6. See the definition's `README` for what to do next.

## Contents

- `containers` - Contains reusable dev container definitions.
- `container-templates` - Contains templates for creating your own container definitions or to [contribute back](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-dev-container-definitions).
- `repository-containers` - Dev container definitions for working public source code repositories.

## Common Questions

### Can I just reuse an existing container image or Docker / Docker Compose configuration?

Yes, if you want to use an existing Dockerfile as a starting point, run **Remote-Containers: Create Container Configuration File...** from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>). You'll be prompted to select a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file and customize from there. If you prefer, you can also start up the container and [attach to it](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/attach).

### What is the goal of `devcontainer.json`?

A `devcontainer.json` file is similar to `launch.json` for debugging, but designed to launch (or attach to) a development container instead. At its simplest, all you need is a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in your project that references an image, `Dockerfile`, or `docker-compose.yml`, and a few properties. You can [adapt it for use](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/folder-setup) in a wide variety of situations.
